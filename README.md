# Streaming Service Data Exploration

This project explores and compares content across major streaming platforms, specifically Disney+ and Netflix, using data-driven insights and visualizations.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze content trends, genres, and characteristics from Disney+ and Netflix using datasets obtained from Kaggle. We aimed to answer key questions about release trends, genre popularity, and content duration differences across platforms. The findings are visualized using tools in R, and this analysis is part of a collaborative academic project for STAT 184.

## Interesting Insight

*Coming soon â€” we will add key insights from our analysis here along with visualizations.*
